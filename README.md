# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is the process of developing softwares and programs by applying engineering concepts to software development with an aim to achieve specific desired outcomes. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering differs from traditional programming since it allows for collaboration between different people in one project whereas traditional programming was more suited for individual work. Software developing also involves using processes such as Agile and Waterfall techniques while traditional had no specific techniques.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

SDLC:
1. Planning and analysis: The user needs is decided and mapped out.
2. Design. The product architecture is mapped out by the software architect based on findings of the planning and analysis.
3. Development: Coding is performed and any other implementations needed.
4.Testing: Review the code to establish whether it works as it was intended to.
5. Deployment: The product is released for usage by the intended users.
6. Maintenance: This is the process of fixing issues detected in the testing. For instance, debugging.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile Vs Waterfall
Waterfall was the founding model of software development and was borrowed from the construction industry. Due to it shortcomings, Agile was developed to counter this.
1. Flexibility: Agile allows for changes as the project is underway while Waterfall is rigid therefore changes are difficult to implement retrogressively.
2. Application and preferences: Agile is preferred where projects are subject to changes while waterfall are preferrred where there are clear expectations.
3. Execution: Agile is divided into sprints and at the end presentations are made while Waterfall is executed inline with Software development life cycle.
 - Agile emphasises Collaboration while Waterfall emphasizes Documentation and planning.
 - Agile is flexible while Waterfall is rigid.
 
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements engineering is the specialization in systems engineering that helps develop and specify system requirements.
The process involves:  
-Requirement management during all phrases.
-Analysing concepts and determining their requirements
-Implementation of the planning stage.
-Management of the entire process.
Importance in SDLC
- Helps in the testing stage of SDLC by comparing the requirements and what was implemented.
-Assists in documentation. Progress made can be tracked through this.
-Ensures the needs of all stakeholders are met. 
-Helps minimize risks. This is by identifying errorsearly and correcting them soon.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity is dividing a software system into sections called modules that can be tested and changed individually. 
It improves maintanability by making the components independent which allows errors to be corrected in the ffected areas without having to sabotage other areas that were in good shape.
It promotes scalability by promoting specialization and collaboration since different people can work on different modules. This makes it easier to make quick progress and scale.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing is a type of testing done at the code level and involves testing individual components and analyzing their functionality.
Intergration testing is testing a group of units intergrated to one system or subsystem.
System testing is testing the whole application intergration.
This is important to ensure all expectations are met and to identify errors as soon as possible and avoid potential calamities
Version Control Systems.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are systems and tools that allow users to change source codes and collaborate together.
They are important as they make collaborations possible and easier. This has contributed to increase in scalability of projects.
Some examples are: Git, SVN and Mercurial.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Software project managers roles are:
Planning. They define the scope of work.
Team management. They manage the talent and ensure targets are met.
Resource management and allocation. They ensure resources are well allocated and used.
Risk management. They ensure all high risk areas of a project are identified and tackled.
Communication link. They are the links between executors and stakeholders.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

This is changing and updating a software after its operations for improvements.
The maintenance activities are:
-Preventive maintenance: Activities to reinforce software in anticipation of a threat and prevent it from being fatal.
-Corrective maintenance: Fixing bugs after they have occurred.
-Adaptive maintenance: Updating softwares to work better in aspecific environment.
-Perfective maintenance: This is intended to increase the general performance.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Some of the ethical issues Engineers face are: Difficulty in establishing intellectual property rights, Quality control of work, transparency and security.
They can adhere to this by:
-Always maintaining clear communication with clients and coworkers.
-Establishing and following set guidelines of the scope of work and control.
-Following professional code of ethics.
-Respecting clients privacy and not giving up their information.
- Whistleblowing on professionals who go against code of ethics.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
